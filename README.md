# BARBARSHOP

## What It Does
BARBARSHOP is a simple web app I built for booking barbershop appointments. Users can pick services, choose times, and manage bookings. It shows my skills in web development, databases, and user authenticationâ€”great for my portfolio!

**Note**: This is a demo project. Add payment systems (like Stripe) for real use.

## Features
- **Book Appointments**: Pick a date, time, and service (e.g., haircut).
- **User Accounts**: Sign up, log in, and manage profiles.
- **Service List**: Browse available services with prices.
- **Admin Panel**: Admins can view bookings and manage services.
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Works on phones and desktops.
- **Notifications**: Get email confirmations for bookings.

## Tech Used
- **Backend**: Python with Flask (simple web framework).
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (basic and clean).
- **Database**: SQLite (easy to set up; supports PostgreSQL too).
- **Tools**:
  - Flask for web routes.
  - SQLAlchemy for database.
  - Bootstrap for styling.
